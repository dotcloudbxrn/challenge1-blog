# challenge1-blog
Attempting to create a blog system using Node, Express and a simple template engine. 

Initially had a file upload for images, but Heroku is not an image hosting site, so it was deleting the uploaded images. So now it's using URL uploads, until I hook it up with another third-party service provider [:

It's deployed here https://challenge1-blog.herokuapp.com/
